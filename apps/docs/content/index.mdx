# OpenKit

![Toolmaker](/toolmaker.png)

OpenKit is a platform for creating, sharing, and discovering tools for AI agents. It consists of three main components:

## 🛠️ Agent Tool Maker

```bash
npm install @opkt/toolmaker
```

Create powerful AI tools:

- **Capability-based Design**: Create structured, scalable, and easy-to-manage tools
- **OpenAI Compatible**: Fully compatible with OpenAI

```typescript
import { Tool } from "@opkt/toolmaker";
import { z } from "zod";

// Create a single-capability tool
const greet = new Tool({
  name: "Greet",
  description: "Greets a person by name",
  schema: z.object({
    name: z.string().describe("Name to greet"),
  }),
  runner: async ({ name }) => ({
    message: `Hello, ${name}!`,
  }),
});
```
