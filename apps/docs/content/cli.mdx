# OpenKit CLI

OpenKit CLI helps you build and publish your tools with simple commands. Whether you're building a calculator, a text analyzer, or any other AI Agent tools, OpenKit CLI makes it easy to share your tools.

Learn more at [OpenKit](https://openkit.fun)

## Installation

You'll need two packages:

- `@opkt/cli` - The CLI tool for building and publishing
- `@opkt/toolmaker` - The SDK for creating tools

```bash
# Install the CLI globally
npm install -g @opkt/cli

# Install the toolmaker in your project
npm install @opkt/toolmaker
```

## Commands

- `openkit login` - Authenticate with OpenKit
- `openkit init` - Create a new tool from template
- `openkit build` - Build your tool for publishing
- `openkit publish` - Publish your tool to OpenKit

## Usage

### Login

Before using OpenKit commands, you need to login to OpenKit:

```bash
openkit login
```

### Quick Start

For a faster setup, you can use our quick template:

```bash
openkit init
```

This will create a new directory with a pre-configured tool structure and example capability.

For more detailed information on creating tools, visit the [Toolmaker SDK documentation](/toolmaker).

### Publishing a Tool

To publish a tool to OpenKit:

1. First, build your tool:

```bash
openkit build
```

2. Then publish it:

```bash
openkit publish
```

The tool will be published to OpenKit, and you'll receive a URL where you can view your published tool on [OpenKit](https://openkit.fun).

### Build Output Details

When you run `openkit build`, the output is generated in the `openkit-dist` directory by default. The built output includes the capabilities defined by Zod schemas and runner functions. By default, the build process looks for an `index.ts` file in the same folder.

- You can specify a different path by using `openkit build [path]`.
- The `index.ts` must export a default `Tool` or `Toolkit` instance.

For a `Tool` instance, the `openkit-dist` structure is:

- `openkit-dist/[toolname]/capabilities`

For a `Toolkit` instance, the `openkit-dist` structure is:

- `openkit-dist/[toolname-a]/capabilities`
- `openkit-dist/[toolname-b]/capabilities`
