# ATM By Synaptic

ATM is a platform for creating, sharing, and discovering tools for your AI agents. It consists of three main components:

## üõ†Ô∏è Agent Tool Maker

```bash
npm install @synaptic-ai/toolmaker
```

Create powerful AI tools with type safety and ease:

- **Type-safe Development**: Build tools using TypeScript and Zod schemas
- **Capability-based Design**: Define clear inputs and outputs for AI consumption

```typescript
import { Tool, ToolCapability } from '@synaptic-ai/toolmaker';
import { z } from 'zod';

// Define a capability with type-safe schema
const greetCapability = new ToolCapability({
  name: 'Greet',
  description: 'Greets a person by name',
  schema: z.object({
    name: z.string().describe("Name to greet")
  }),
  runner: async ({ name }) => ({
    message: `Hello, ${name}!`
  })
});
```

## üì¶ Agent Tool Manager

```bash
npm install -g @synaptic-ai/atm
```

Build and share your tools:

- **Easy Integration**: `atm build` produces a schema and runner that can be easily integrated with OpenAI SDK.
- **Simple Publishing**: Build and publish with a few commands

```bash
# Build and publish your tool
atm build
atm publish
```

## üè™ Agent Tool Marketplace
